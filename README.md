# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Profitability Checker

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that allows users to analyze whether a stock is potentially profitable using basic financial metrics.

The script uses real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` library, and calculates key metrics such as:

- âœ… Annualized return  
- âœ… Volatility  
- âœ… Sharpe Ratio  
- âœ… Beta (against the S&P 500)

The user just inputs a stock ticker (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `GOOGL`) and the script fetches one year of data, performs financial analysis, and tells you whether the stock appears profitable based on the Sharpe ratio and return.
